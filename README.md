# Getting Excited About CSS

Slidedeck for my talk at [Codemotion Berlin 2016](http://berlin2016.codemotionworld.com/wp-content/themes/event/detail-talk.php?detail=4851)

## Abstract

CSS is not the most obvious first programming language, but we at CSSclasses believe that it is one of the quickest and most fun ways to get your hands into coding. In this talk I will explain how we use CSS to get people excited about programming. I will also show you how to overcome common frustrations with CSS and how to make your everyday work with stylesheets more interesting and enjoyable.
